    "text": "Here are a few pieces of my work!\nModern Nudity is a narrative journalism piece that looks at the lives of modern-day art models and how they are perceived by the private eye of the art world, as well as the public.\nThere is a certain feeling one gets when walking through a museum. As my heels clicked rhythmically across the polished floors of the National Gallery of Art, I could feel the weight of centuries of humanity pressing in on me. Under this feeling, I wandered from room to room until I found myself seated on a long wooden bench surrounded by the work of French artist Auguste Renoir. I was in front of Bather Arranging Her Hair, in which a young woman standing naked worked to part her hair surrounded by items of clothing.\nI sat to view the painting and rest for a moment, but soon I was more carried away by watching the people who approached the work. “See, these women, they aren’t treated as people, they’re treated as little things to paint”, a young woman stated to her friends in a matter-of-fact tone as they stood around it. Shortly after, a teenage girl holding hands with her partner approached. They stood for just a moment, then snapped a photo before continuing their stroll. After sitting for a bit, I straightened myself and began wandering again until I landed in front of another nude study. In the National Gallery of Art, it is assumed that nude portraiture, both male and female, will be looked at with appreciation. I watched group after group walk in front of barely clothed women, pausing for a moment or two to let their eyes wander over the painted figures. Some remarked how brilliant the technique or some other aspect was, others stood in silence, and some merely stopped for a second, eyes fleeting around the work and then moving along. Yet, as I watched these people examine the portraits, I never once heard a comment in the vein of she should leave more to the imagination, or I can’t believe they would allow themselves to be seen publicly like that. Shame is not tied to the “classical” nude portrait as it is to nudity in modern society. A model told me once that whereas in the art community his nudity is viewed as a necessity, in the real world it is viewed as taboo. As my heels echoed through the galleries, I ruminated on this idea. Does the impact of the naked figure vary based on its context? Throughout history, models who sat for artists were regarded from one extreme to the other. In the Renaissance, to be the muse of an artist was seen as a great privilege. Two centuries later the sitting model was seen as nothing more than a prostitute. I wondered if it was just the lens I was viewing it through. Even further than that, I wondered what it was like to sit for an artist in today’s age.\nA week later I found myself in contact with a local figure model. The sun had just set as I was leaving my apartment to head in the direction of the White House. Avid Light, a model, and member of the DC Art Model Collective (DCAMC), just finished a long session with the Corcoran School of Art at GW and was looking to wind down with a beer before heading home. \nAvid would go on later to tell me that the DCAMC is a collective run by models to help establish a baseline for professional standards. As the collective states, its goal is to “create a network that connects life models to each other, to the artists that work with us, and to our communities in and around Washington DC”. There are about 15 main models that make up the collective, each of them participating in both in-person and on-video sessions in a variety of different styles. They have become a sort of “first base” for new models in the DC area, helping them find their footing within this industry. I made the cold 15-minute walk from my place to a restaurant near the Renwick Gallery where I told Avid I would meet him for dinner. I wanted to understand more about the lives of modern figure models. When I arrive, I head straight to the back where a man in his mid-50s rises from his table to greet me with a warm hug. This caught me slightly off-guard as it was our first time meeting, but with such a gentle demeanor it seemed natural for him. Avid is quite tall with no hair and a slim build almost unnoticeable under layers of sweatshirts and scarves. After we share hellos, I take a seat across from him and begin stripping off some of my layers to get more comfortable in the heat of the restaurant. Looking at him under the dim yellow light at the table, I notice he has a kind face slightly wrinkled with memories of good times and bad. We slip into small talk, discussing the weather and some current events, and eventually, I ask him how his session went. It was his first time back at Corcoran and things were off to a bumpy start. Along with an on-time (but late in Avid’s opinion) arrival, he had not met the professor and he still had to shake out some of the dust and nerves that had collected over COVID. The studio Avid posed in was in the basement of the Corcoran building, windowless and quite cold. It was an intro-level art class and the students were focused on capturing a series of short poses in sketches and then a few long ones to work on detailing. Avid works from the center of the room with lighting coming from down below, pointing up at him. Models often work with a stool, block, chair, or something that will give them a place of leverage as well. A place to sit, lean, or place an arm or a leg. Overall, it was a good and fairly standard session.\nWe continue chatting about our days as our food arrives and he mentions retiring from his government job. Seeming a drastic change from life modeling, I wondered what he did for the government. It was a secure job, I had clearance and everything. The functional thing that I was doing in my last few years was with formulations within the defense area. So, working with building and sustaining relationships with our foreign partners. So [modeling] was very much a counterbalance in some ways. I liked [my job], but it was stressful, very challenging, and lots of rules and limitations. I mean, I don’t mean that in a bad way, just a lot of overhead. I’ve learned it’s common that art models come from all different walks of life. Some, such as Avid, use the arts as a way to balance their life, a creative outlet to release stress. Others find modeling at a young age and venture into it as a full-time career. There is no right way or set path to begin art modeling, leaving it open to be a hobby or something more professional. I had started meeting a lot of other people that were like, intelligence analysts and people that were doing heavy-duty government-mission work and had a very different creative or artistic thing on the side. That ran a really wide range. I mean, everything from people who got heavily into Civil War reenacting and they’re, you know, an intelligence person or cryptanalysts or something. Then on the side, they’re a seamstress making dresses for, you know, Civil War events or something like that, right? A lot of real creativity, and not to get too much into the psychology of it, but kind of realizing it’s not that weird, actually, to have those different sides to you. Avid continued picking his way through his sandwich and sipping on a palm-sized can of beer while telling stories of the interesting hobbies he’s come across in his career. After his life in the government ended, he reached a moment of uncertainty. COVID had made its impact on the arts, leaving in-person modeling sessions at a complete standstill. Avid was unsure as to whether there would even be any modeling for him to do. Luckily, he found the DCAMC which helped him establish a reputation for quality online modeling sessions. While the modeling scene is fairly freelance, there are still “etiquette things and sort of traditional things to learn about how you handle everything, from how you handle payment or tipping to how you handle the nudity part.” It turns out that while there is a good amount of industry “etiquette” to learn, Avid tells me a lot of it comes down to the “spidey senses” you develop along the way as well. You pick up techniques along the way, learn what you are good at and not so good at, and pick up on the reputations of those around you. Of course, as with any industry, there are all different types of people involved, including those who are going to push, or even break, the boundaries of what is socially acceptable. Like anybody else, artists are all over the map as far as personalities. Most of them are pretty cool, in general, it’s a great realm of people to work with. I’ve had more weird inquiries than things I have actually done. It is interesting, when you put yourself out there as a model you definitely attract them. I’m sure young women probably get even more. But I was actually surprised that I do. It hasn’t been terrible, but it’s kind of weird on the internet when you put your profile together as a model or whatever. Okay, friend requests and contacts from people around the world, yes. But there are some pretty creepy guys that are – they may be gay guys, and that’s fine, but they’re a little bit weird. You know, they start sending me pictures or something. The models themselves need to decide where they draw their boundaries as well. The posing in itself can be a very intimate situation. It is a scenario in which the model can be very vulnerable and exposed. Moving from one position to another, the model bares him or herself for the room to see, allowing artists to study every portion of their body. Because of this, the model must establish and set boundaries for themselves as to what is and is not acceptable during a session or when talking to the model. These lines are especially important to solidify if the model is working across various mediums. As Avid explains, multiple sessions of long posing for the classical arts can be more rigorous on the body than a short one to two hour session of photography that pays similarly. If you kind of hit a jackpot, you could get a two hour gig with the photographer, make a few hundred bucks. But, then within that space, without trying to be judgemental, some of the money is what you’re willing to do. So, it kind of gets tied together a little bit. People that do a lot of that work have to really think hard about what, you know, what’s the bar for them? What will they do? There’s almost a whole sub-industry… If you want me to describe the range, as you can imagine, [it’s] everything from very, very mild to full on hardcore porn or something like that. There’s a whole spectrum. Models, in their own time, need to have a conversation with themselves and find where they draw that line. Sometimes that line comes from a predetermined judgment about what the model is and is not willing to do, but sometimes it comes from poor experiences and uncomfortable sessions. A job that pushes comfort levels may pay triple the pay amount of their regular work; this “temptation” often being the main draw to this type of work according to Avid. If you’re willing to do almost anything, you can make a lot of money. Models that I know have had to actually stop and say “OK, well, at this point, it’s not worth it. Even if I’m making 500 bucks, I’m not, ya know…” And also thinking long term, you don’t want to ruin your reputation and become, like, “Oh, you’re one of those models” or whatever. I think that’s one of the areas where the models in this little collective help each other a lot too, because somebody relatively new may not realize what they’re opening themselves up to. For Avid, at the end of the day, the models are there for their bodies and to provide a service with them. He sees himself as part of the art making process, an essential piece of the work.\nFor model Emily Butterfield, she agrees she is also providing a service in that she gets paid for people to paint and sketch her body. But, she also is in love with the idea of being a muse. As I sat down with her several days later in a hip restaurant in Silver Springs, I asked what drove her to modeling and she doubled down on this idea. \nWhen I was in college, I guess around that age, I wanted to start. I guess it just sort of naturally happened. I mean, I don’t really have a good answer for that other than I wanted to be in pictures. \nEmily is 32, slightly tall, fit, and vibrating with energy and intensity as we sit to talk about her career. She has always been interested in the arts and experimenting in different disciplines and views modeling as no different. In terms of classical arts modeling, Emily is also part of the DCAMC and models for various universities as well as small art groups.\nI’ve gone back and forth, starting and stopping with photography modeling because it can get pretty crazy, pretty fast. I wanted to try it again around my late twenties, I felt this like, renewed sense of agency. And I guess, maybe this also reduces the mortality of, like, “I’m not going to be hot forever”, you know?\nThere is a certain amount of joy for these models in allowing their bodies to explore space and the limits of what it can do.  But, as Emily tells me in between bites of food, \"It's a job that can be really meaningful and it can also be a pile of dicks\".  Just as Avid had explained, there are boundaries to what models are and are not open to. For Emily and many others, anything unsolicited is automatically an end to a conversation or a session.  \nWhen I say “creepy”, like, “things get creepy for us”, I don’t mean that things get sexual fast, because they do [get sexual], but it’s the way they get sexual. The non-agency respecting sexual... I’ve had conversations where I’ve been naked in front of a bunch of people and somehow organically pointed out that I was naked and everyone, you know, was like “no you’re nude,” and it’s like, how the fuck are you going to tell me what I am, first off? Like, “I know, I’m doing the job, are you naked here?” Secondly, why is it so important to you to use the word ‘nude’ instead of ‘naked’, and then, explain to me why it is so important. In a nutshell, it’s so important because “sex is dirty and you can’t be naked”, you know? And fuck that. \nWhen a model shows up for a session, general artist etiquette is to understand the model is there for figure reference and they must be treated with respect in that regard. Everything that happens during a session should be decided upon beforehand to ensure that everyone is comfortable. Whether it is a class studying movement or a photography session in a sex dungeon, the model is there to provide a predetermined service and that is all. \nFor a while, though, Emily did not have the means, or the “luxury” to turn down sessions and found herself caught in a loop with some disrespectful artists. I just felt like, “stop sexualizing me and stop making jokes about your creepy, gross, flattening fantasies.” And really, what I meant was, “stop sexualizing me in a way that doesn’t include my agency, in a way that doesn’t include my consent.” Technically, my consent is being used, but it’s not my story. This is a common complaint within the modeling community, something both Avid and Emily have experienced and know others have experienced as well. They, as the woman in the art gallery commented, are being treated as objects to paint. This removes the model’s voice and autonomy from the work they are taking part in. Definitely one thing that doesn’t get talked about in terms of sexuality that has been really misunderstood for me as a model, at least within photography, but also for other [disciplines], is that I have a performative sexuality. I don’t just mean that – like usually when we hear performative sexuality you think of someone, like, giving a blowjob and they’re not really enjoying it. But, you know, I don’t mean that. I mean, I have my Sasha Fierce and my Beyonce. So I have a lot of stuff photography-wise for shoots that I want to set up. For example, a friend and I shot in a sex dungeon. And then I suddenly realized something. I couldn’t figure out why he was a little embarrassed, and then I realized that it’s because he actually frequents it. And that’s fine, but it’s also, “oh, I get it because the subject of what we’re shooting is something you actually want to do”. But I have my personal life, and these particular things didn’t happen to correspond to my actual sexuality. So there’s a lot of visuals that I am really drawn to that have a sexuality, but they’re not my private sexuality or things I want when I’m having sex. Emily enjoys her sexuality and the sexual nature she can bring to a photography session. The same as she may bring joy or sorrow or darkness to a session, sexuality is no different for her, and she feels it should be treated the same. Her goal is to create a beautiful piece of work that both she and the artist are proud of. Beyond being the model, Emily has aspirations for the modeling community. There is currently no curriculum in place for men or women who want to begin modeling. It seems strange to her since there is training for the artists and there is also training for runway and fashion models, but not art models. To be able to sit and pose for an hour to three hours, not only must one have the physical and mental ability for it, but they must also understand what the artist or class wants from them. What are common gesture poses? How does one remain still for so long in one position? How do you emote for long periods during long-pose sessions? She notes, “There are mechanics that can be taught, similar to vocal training.” None of these questions come with inherent answers to the model. Maybe some are more naturally attuned to this work than others, but there is still technique that can be taught and learned. That is what Emily wants to help with. She wants to give a voice to models and fix the lack of understanding as to what the job entails.\nWhen I returned to the National Gallery of Art again, I felt as though I had a new set of eyes to view the art with. No, the models were not just things to paint, but they were as much a part of the creation as the artist themself. \nI walked through the galleries and stopped in front of Repose by Jean-Baptiste Corot. A young woman lays naked, outdoors, on a daybed. Her body is faced mostly away from the viewer with her head turned towards us over her shoulder. I imagine the process going similarly to those I have witnessed recently. The model undresses and lays herself in the position the artist chooses, and then remains that way until she or the artist needs rest. No matter the era the art is created, there will always be differing opinions on how the body should be viewed. It raises the question for me: is it fair that the art piece is viewed with awe and admiration if the model is not? And how is that gap bridged? Regardless of the answers to these questions, if there are answers, models will continue to sit for artists, no matter the medium, and inspire them. Avid and Emily will continue to pose and create art, and respond accordingly when people heckle or praise them for their work. The art modeling community is a vibrant place full of people with their own quirks and personalities. This variety helps add to the uniqueness of the pieces we see hanging before us in galleries across the country. Without them, we would not have much of the work we know and love today."

    "text": "Covid Memorial takes a look at a site setup on the national mall to honor the lives of those lost to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nIn the spring of 1963 Yoko Ono wrote a piece entitled “Cloud Piece”.\nImagine the clouds dripping. Dig a hole in your garden to put them in.\nLooking out across the expanse of the National Mall, it looked as though someone had opened a hole for fallen clouds. Seemingly endless fields of nearly blinding, sparkling white, in front of the Washington Monument. Only when approached can one begin to distinguish the small shapes from one another.\nWhite flags, thousands of them, placed individually and orderly in differently shaped patches. Surrounding and in between the patches of white were tourists and visitors. Couples embracing or taking selfies to capture the moment. Families with parents running after their children attempting to corral and control them. Photographers setup with their gear and tripods attempting to capture the energy of it all. And every now and then, someone crouching to place a flag of their own.\nEvery flag placed represents a loved one lost to COVID-19. On some flags there are even messages and names written.\nWe love and miss you everyday… Can’t wait to see you again in heaven\nBut as it is in most touristy areas, the memorial mostly serves as another stop on a traveler’s itinerary of sights to see. Being in front of a historic monument, the memorial lends itself to a great bustling of sight-seers moving through and in between the flags. It creates a hum of noise to contrast or maybe accompany the memory of those lost to the illness.\nAgainst the noise, however, there remains a sense of stillness. Looking out upon the field, the eyes are easily drawn to lack of motion. A man crouched on the ground placing his flag and then remaining. Hands planted firmly in the grass, eyes closed, shut out from the rest of the world, he radiated a grief that could be felt from the opposite end. Down another path a woman walked slowly, arms crossed and brows set close together. Her eyes looking downward, she appeared focused on reading the individual messages, recognizing the loss of the lives represented through the white plastic.\nEvery twenty or thirty feet this pattern repeated: a sprinkle of individuals moving quickly and swiftly around a body crouched in grief. As everyone moves through their days concerned with themselves and their own motives, sometimes the cycle is broken. If only just for a moment, the woman walking, the man crouching, or the visitor simply passing through are pulled out of their world and into the thoughts of another."
